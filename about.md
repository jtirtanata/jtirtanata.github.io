I am a data scientist in Metis.

### More Information
Graduated with a degree in Computer Science and a concentration in Mathematics from Columbia University. Upon graduation, I started a 1 year residency program in Google, where I was given 3 months of training, followed by exposure to different parts of the company in two 4.5 month cycles. I have completed a rotation with Google Ads and Google Classroom, where I was doing backend C++ and iOS development respectively. After completing my internship program, I converted to working full time in Google Sites. I've decided to dive deeper into the world of data science and I am currently enrolled in Metis. I will be graduating on March 31st, 2017.
